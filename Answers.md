1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Server-side routing is when all pages live on the server and when a user clicks to go to a different page, the request goes to the server and it has to come back to the user causing the whole page to refresh. While client-side routing, slow on first load, is more smooth for the user because the "pages" are served up by the Javascript.
